# Ruby solutions for Advent of Code 2020:

What a better time to learn a new language than during AoC, I chose Ruby for this one as I have always been under the assumption (wrongly, I believe) that Python is (and should be) the go-to interpreted language for quickly solving problems. 

_Notes:_

* To add as days elapsed, what has been good about using Ruby vs. another language?

_To Do:_

* Update day 5 part-2 code to import part-1 code and reuse it.
* Re-do solutions for days 1 to 3 when possible, these were either originally done in Python or I didn't particularly like the rushed code.
